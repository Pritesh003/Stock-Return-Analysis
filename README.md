#### Stock-Return-Analysis
**We have analysed two major companies from the Pharma sector and answered the questions as below.**
 - Import their stock prices of a one-year duration (before March 2020).
 - Plot their return graph.
 - Calculate mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis for each stock.
 - Calculate the correlation of both the stocks. 
 - Observe the movement of the sector index during the considered time.
 - Explain the correlation vs causation involved here.
 - State why we use variance as a risk measure.
 - Why stock return distribution is not a Normal curve?
